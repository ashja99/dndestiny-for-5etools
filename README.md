## Known issues
It should be obvious this is far from complete. These issues are limited to things I have made an attempt at getting to work, but have not been able to, rather than a list of the many, many things that simply have not been implemented yet.
1. Captain's proficiency can't be overridden from the default value of +2 for CR 3 creatures. Should be +3.
1. link to "burning" condition doesn't work, although it is highlighted as if it is recognized as a valid condition.
